## Welcome to the LEAP Hand ROS1 SDK

### On Ubuntu
- Install [ROS 1 Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) normally first on Ubuntu 20.04.
#### If you need an environment (venv is slightly less buggy than conda with ROS)
- `python -m venv test_env`
- `source test_env/bin/activate`
#### Add this to a [catkin_workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace) named catkin_ws using instructions below.  
- `mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src` (If you do not have a workspace from your current project)
- Next, copy the ros_module folder from this Github into the newly created src folder.  Then:
- `cd ~/catkin_ws/`
- `pip install empy==3.3.4 catkin_pkg pyyaml rospkg` 
- `catkin_make`
#### Setup Bashrc
- `echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc`
- `source ~/.bashrc`
#### First time preparation
- `pip install dynamixel_sdk numpy`
- `sudo chmod 777 /dev/serial/by-id/*`
-  cd ~/catkin_ws/src/ros_module
- `chmod +x leaphand_node.py`
#### To Launch
- Connect 5v power to the hand (the dynamixels should light up during boot up.)
- Connect the Micro USB cable to the hand (Do not use too many USB extensions)
- Find the USB port using [Dynamixel Wizard](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_wizard2/)
- `roslaunch example.launch`
#### How to use
- This is an example Launch script for just LEAP Hand.  The hand should come to life.  It makes topics you can publish to and services. You can see that with for example:
- `rostopic list`
- `rosservice list`
- `rosservice call leap_position`
- Publishing commands the hand and querying the services asks to receive data.
- Please see ros_example.py for example python code that uses this LEAP Module.
- Also see leaphand_node.py, the actual ros module, for further details.  It wraps the Python API.  It should be easy to read.  :)
